      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/profile_pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Benga Akingbe">
      <p>My name is Benga Akingbe. I am 31 years old. I currently work as an accountant for a biomass production company named Enviva. I have only been working there for about a year and a half but I have been working in accounting in one way or another for around 10 years. I attented the University of Maryland and graduated with a degree in Public Health. Now you might question how someone who graduated with a Public Health degree became an accountant. Well, it's a long story. You also might question how someone with a Public Health Degree, who works as an accountant wound up in a coding class. I guess you can say I have been searching for my passion. Hopefully, I have finally foud it.</p>
      <p>Something you need to know about me: I am a huge DC sports fan. I support all of the local teams. Even though we haven't experienced much success in a while, I stay faithful as a fan. If I were to rank my favorite teams, it would be as follows:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Redskins</li>
        <li>Wizards</li>
        <li>Nationals</li>
        <li>Maryland Basketball</li>
        <li>Maryland Football</li>
